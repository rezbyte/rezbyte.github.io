# rezbyte.github.io

My personal portfolio built with [`svelte-kit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

All styling done from scratch using CSS.
No other frameworks or libraries used.

# Developing

Install the dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

# Deployment

The `docs` folder contains the deployed version.

To deploy the site, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

and commit the `docs` folder to main.
